* This Is Deep learning base Text Document identifier. For Example if some paper is about politics it will identify it as a political paper, similarly with other types of documents

* Steps involved:-
      - 1). Convert the image into the Text using OCR
      - 2). Cleaning text.
      - 3)  Making the text embedding
      - 4)  spliting the train test using tensorflow dataset API
      - 5)  Feeding the data to model 
      - 6)  Creating Custom CallBacks
      - 7)  After training getting the prediction
      - 8). Converting the prediction into the classifcaiton label such as politics, medical etc.
     
*This Uses Reccurent Neural Network Which is Long short Term memory (LSTM) model for training
